Step-by-Step Guide Based on the Video:

1\. Accessing the Email Portal:

Open a web browser and navigate to mail.nepal.gov.np.

Enter your username (provided by the government IT department) and password.

2\. Navigating the Dashboard:

Once logged in, familiarize yourself with the dashboard.

The dashboard includes sections for inbox, sent items, drafts, and folders for organizing emails.

3\. Composing an Email:

Click on the "Compose" button.

Enter the recipient's email address (e.g., xyz@nepal.gov.np), subject line, and email body.

Attach any necessary files using the attachment option.

Review and click "Send."

4\. Organizing Emails:

Create folders to sort emails by project, department, or priority.

Use labels for quick identification.

5\. Changing Your Password:

Go to account settings.

Select the "Change Password" option and follow the instructions.

Ensure your password is strong and secure.

6\. Security Best Practices:

Always log out after using the email, especially on shared devices.

Do not share your password with others.

Be cautious of phishing attempts and report suspicious emails to the IT department.

7\. Troubleshooting Common Issues:

For login issues, ensure your credentials are correct and the CAPS LOCK key is off.

If you forget your password, use the "Forgot Password" feature or contact IT support.

Clear browser cache if the email portal isn't loading properly.

8\. Using Email on Mobile:

Configure your official email on mobile email apps like Gmail or Outlook.

Use the IMAP/SMTP settings provided in the video for seamless access.

Additional Notes:

The video includes a practical walkthrough for visual learners. Watch it for a detailed demonstration.

If further assistance is required, contact your department's IT help desk.
